# 3DWindwill-with-WebGL

To see the project, you should download the project and open Windmill -> Windmill -> windmill.html.

In this project I used perspective projection. We can control the camera with changing values of FOVY, camera position on 3 axis (x, y and z) and camera target on 3 axis. We can transform the windmill by changing position on 3 axis, scaling and rotating on 3 axis. Additionally, we can modify speed of the windmill's propeller and color of the windmill's body.
